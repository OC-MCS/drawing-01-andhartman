Grading comments:  
Drawing off of top/right edge (allowing partial shapes) -3
Missing comment block header  -3 (see rubric in assignment)
Calling get_shapes() every time in drawing loop very inefficient...if you have 500 shapes you're getting 500 copies of the vector every time in loop -1  
Grade: 43/50
